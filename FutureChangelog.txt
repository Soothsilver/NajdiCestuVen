Old notes on engine:
---------------
Requirements:
 - save and load at any voice line, or when nothing is happening
 - move between rooms, have some memory for arbitrary level-based data
 - tips are global, and unlocked even if you don't find them in the room
 - rollback does not need to work, but it might be nice, but what needs to work is Log (but not across save/load)
 - after you unlock something once, it's unlocked forever
 - you can start from any room
 - your actions will have no consequences outside individual levels
 
A *save file* consists of a screenshot, timestamp, scene name, and the session.
A *session* consists of:
 - the active script, if any; this may either be a full script or the script ID if it's a non-anonymous script;
 - the position in the active script;
 - the ID of the room;
 - persistable properties of the room (your location, flags, your inventory, whether an interactible was interacted with)
 - 
 
As a save file is loaded, the active script, if any, is fast-forwarded to the selected position. This causes proper art, items and speakers to be displayed, and proper music and background sfx to play.
