# Najdi cestu ven! / Seek a way out!
*Najdi cestu ven!*/*Seek a way out!* is an escape-the-room adventure about a group of children trapped in a mysterious castle. Name subject
to change. 

It's also a spin-off of my Scouting webcomic. The player palys Tišík, a clever but inexperienced child, on a weekend Scouting trip to the mysterious Hut of Terror. Together with other children, you must solve puzzles and observe your surroundings to find your way out of rooms.

You can play the tech demo at https://nsnbc.neocities.org/seek-a-way-out.html. It's available in Czech and English and distributed in Microsoft Store, Google Play and as a Windows installer.

### Release plan
I plan to release the full version in December 2020, and the game will be available for free under the GPL.

### Contributing
If you'd like to help with development, send me an email at petrhudecek2010@gmail.com or contact me here on GitHub.

I'm seeking help with:

* **Story writing** and general text writing
* Programming, but probably only from people I know or who seem dedicated enough
* Art, to an extent, as I need to keep to the style of the webcomic
* Music
